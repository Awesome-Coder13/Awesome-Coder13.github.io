<h1><u>What is a Raspberry Pi?</u> </h1>



<p> The Raspberry Pi is a small affordable computer around the size of a credit card.<br>
It was designed to help young people learn programming. <br>
 But at around $35 CAD -- almost anybody can get one, and start programming!<br>
 Check out our projects page to see what we do with Raspberry Pi!
