Connecting to your Raspberry Pi with VNC Viewer
There are two ways to connect to your Raspberry Pi. You can use either or both, depending on what works best for you.</li>

<li>ESTABLISHING A DIRECT CONNECTION
Direct connections are quick and simple providing you're joined to the same private local network as your Raspberry Pi. For example, this might be a wired or wireless network at home, at school, or in the office).

On your Raspberry Pi (using a terminal window or via SSH) use these instructions or run ifconfig to discover your private IP address.

On the device you'll use to take control, download VNC Viewer. For best results, use the compatible app from RealVNC.

Enter your Raspberry Pi's private IP address into VNC Viewer:</li>
